# Analyzed-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions

## Dataset
The dataset was released by the New York City government and provides invaluable insights into motor vehicle collisions in NYC, serving as a crucial resource for analyzing trends and 
patterns in these incidents. I selected this dataset because motor vehicle collisions pose significant public safety concerns and carry substantial economic and social costs. 
My objective is to leverage these findings to provide policymakers with informed insights and contribute to the development of robust strategies aimed at mitigating both the 
frequency and severity of these collisions.
