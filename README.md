# Analyzed-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions

## Project Overview
I analyzed the Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset from NYC Open Data. This dataset contains details of all motor vehicle collisions reported by the NYPD in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and Staten Island. I focused on data from 2019 to 2022 to identify trends and outliers, as this period includes pre-COVID, during-COVID, and post-COVID data. With 26 different columns in the dataset, I selected specific identifiers to support my analysis. These identifiers include:

1. Total collisions per borough per year.
2. Top collision contributing factors.
3. Vehicle injury type per borough, per time of day, & per season.
4. Number of people killed by vehicle type.
5. Weather as a contributing factor to motor vehicle collisions.

## Dataset
The dataset was released by the New York City government and provides invaluable insights into motor vehicle collisions in NYC, serving as a crucial resource for analyzing trends and patterns in these incidents. I selected this dataset because motor vehicle collisions pose significant public safety concerns and carry substantial economic and social costs. 
My objective is to leverage these findings to provide policymakers with informed insights and contribute to the development of robust strategies aimed at mitigating both the 
frequency and severity of these collisions.

## Below are the key findings from our analysis:

#### Collision Trends by Borough
- Inattentive or distracted driving
- Failure to yield the right of way

#### Vehicle Injury Types Across Seasons:
- Fall Season: The highest number of pedestrian injuries occurs during this time of year.
- Summer: The highest number of motorist and cyclist injuries occurs during this time of year.
